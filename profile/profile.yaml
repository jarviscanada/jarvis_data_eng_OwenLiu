summary: "Hi there, my name is Owen Liu. I am an aspiring industrial engineering new grad from the University of Toronto. I specialized in operations research, data analysis, and project management. As a current Jarvis employee, I had one research assistant experience with professor Hedergott from the University of Amsterdam and several industry-relevant core projects in my undergrad. The data industry is redefining and reconstructing our daily life with new challenges emerging every day.  I am eager to share my insights, learn from the game changers, and eventually impact the industry and beyond."
