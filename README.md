# Owen Liu . Jarvis Consulting

Hi there, My name is Owen Liu, I am an aspiring industrial engineering new grad from the University of Toronto. I specialized in operations research, data analysis, and project management. I had one research assistant experience with professor Hedergott from the University of Amsterdam and several industry-relevant core projects in my undergrad. The data industry is redefining and reconstructing our daily life with new challenges emerging every day.  I am eager to share my insights, learn from the game changers, and eventually impact the industry and beyond.

## Highlighted Projects
**An Information Retrieval Digital Platform for EV Stations**: - Developed a full-stack cloud-based system that retrieves a large volume of electric vehicle charging stations data from the client's database. Transformed the data that caters to the interest and ability of users. Visulizaed and presented the data to end users in an easy-to-consume format with computer engineering and computer science students. - Conducted a complete data integration process(ETL) including retrieval of 500K tuples of data given, elementary data analysis (EDA), data transformation and verification, and data integrations, which generates required assorted data to end users. - Retrieved raw data from AWS data migration service.
 - Established PostgreSQL connection to migrated database.
 - Adopted python in data cleaning, transformation, integration, analysis, and passing back to the database.
 - Adopted python sk-learn, matplotlib tools in data visualizations.

**A Developer Job Satisfaction Predictor**:  - Predicted job satisfaction from a poll survey conducted by the StackOverFlow community. - Performed data cleaning, amputation, and parsing to raw data. - Visualized the data through sklearn and matplotlib tools in python. - Applied logistic regression, decision tree, clustering to develop diffrent models. - Attained precision of distinct models with a confusion matrix. - Predicted job satisfaction from such models through simulation.

**Airport Passenger Movement Simulation**:  - Modeled historical data of passenger arrivals, check-ins, and security screening. - Optimized the system for efficiency and cost, and provided budget-permitting upgrading business decisions. - Applied, analyzed, and tested the fitness of presumed statistical distributions over the historical data with Kirmogorov and Smirnov Test using R. - Designed a Simio model to model the real-time passenger movement.

**An Online Earphone Encyclopedia Website**:  - Developed a fully interactive website including functions like search, sort, review, account creation and edition. - Used Java Objected Oriented Programming, Microsoft Access, SQL to establish back-end, server connection. - Enhanced Agile/Scrum project methodology. - Gave a demo/release speech on behalf of the team.
